iOS Info Releasing
------------------
The following steps need to be done if the certificate in AppStoreConnect (ASC) expires.
1) Generate the certificate from ASC. The certificate in ASC created by certificate signing request created locally. This means that the certificate generated will be have the local private key.
2) After generation download the certificate and install it locally. The certificate should show your own private key.
3) Export this private key without any password. For CodeMagic build this private key needs to be created in plain text format using the command "openssl pkcs12 -in IOS_DISTRIBUTION.p12 -nodes -nocerts | openssl rsa -out ios_distribution_private_key". The .p12 file here is created by exporting the private key from KeyChain.
4) Set this in CodeMagic env var.
